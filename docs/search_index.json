Were not trying to be an exhaustive resource for all chemists or courses. Rather, were focusing on developing broadly applicable data science course content (tutorials and recipes) based in Microsoft Excel for chemistry courses and research.

This will mimic Lab 1. ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## NAPS Time O3 NO2 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 60435 2019-01-01 00:00:00 8 10 ## 2 60435 2019-01-01 01:00:00 5 14 ## 3 60435 2019-01-01 02:00:00 9 8 ## 4 60435 2019-01-01 03:00:00 12 6 ## 5 60435 2019-01-01 04:00:00 13 7 ## 6 60435 2019-01-01 05:00:00 17 5 We can also make it even easier to directly copy the table for smaller example datasets. Students can just paste into excel and work along with the chapter. 2.2 Animated GIFS We can readily record gifs of our Excel operations, and embedded them directly into the bookdown book. For the example below, I used LICEcap. Its lightweight, and does exactly what I wanted it to. 2.3 Embedded videos And lastly, we can readily embed videos directly on the webpage. Based on the video below, if CHNM135 students could have used their excel skills to close major business dealings in 1992 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
