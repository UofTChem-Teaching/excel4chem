This resource has been developed to guide you through the data analysis component of the first year labs and we hope the skills you learn will help you succeed in chemistry and beyond! The majority of this online resources uses air quality data collected by the Canadian government through Environment and Climate Change Canada’s National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) program. NAPS has been operating since 1969, and has 286 stations across 203 communities. As a companion to this Excel resource we have also developed the CHM135: Exploring Air Quality Data App, which can be used to explore and visualize data across the country. The example dataset used throughout this resource can be downloaded here. 1.1 Ozone is Not Our Friend As an introduction to the chemistry we will in this activity, watch this video, which describes some of the major chemical contributors to poor urban air quality. A transcript of the video can be downloaded here. Stratospheric ozone protects us from harmful UV radiation from the sun, but at ground-level it is toxic and high concentrations are often the cause of poor air quality days. The video explores the relationship between ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), two important secondary pollutants whose relationship is described by reactions (\\(\\ref{eq1}\\)) to (\\(\\ref{eq3}\\)) below. These two pollutants will act as the basis for our discussion of air quality in this exercise. \\[ \\begin{align} NO_2 + h\\nu → NO + O &amp;&amp; \\label{eq1}\\tag{1} \\\\ O + O_2 → O_3 &amp;&amp; \\label{eq2}\\tag{2} \\\\ O_3 + NO → O_2 + NO_2 &amp;&amp; \\label{eq3}\\tag{3} \\end{align} \\] As mentioned in the video, the atmospheric concentrations of NO2 and O3 are related to one another. This relationship is so intimate that reporting the concentration of one without the other is of limited utility. To embrace this relationship, atmospheric chemists have defined the term “odd oxygen” or OX as the sum of the concentration of NO2 and O3 as shown in equation (\\(\\ref{eq4}\\)) below. (Note that in chemistry we denote the concentration of a chemical using a square bracket ‘[]’) \\[ \\begin{align} [O_3] + [NO_2] &amp;= [O_X] \\label{eq4}\\tag{4} \\end{align} \\] 1.2 Atmospheric Concentration Units The NAPS datasets report concentrations of NO2 and O3 in units of parts per billion or ppb. The “parts per” unit describes the ratio of a certain type of molecule or atom as compared to the total molecules or atoms present. A percentage is a “parts per” unit you may be familiar with, it is parts per hundred (pph). Molecular oxygen (O2) is 21% or 21 pph of our atmosphere (e.g. out of a total of one hundred molecules (or moles) in the atmosphere 21 will be oxygen). \\[ \\begin{align} [O_2] &amp;= \\frac{n_{O_2}}{n_{total}} \\times 100 = 21 pph \\label{eq5}\\tag{5} \\end{align} \\] Carbon dioxide (CO2) is present at concentrations around 400 ppm (parts per million) in the current atmosphere (e.g., out of a total of one million molecules in the atmosphere 400 will be carbon dioxide). \\[ \\begin{align} [CO_2] &amp;= \\frac{n_{CO_2}}{n_{total}} \\times 10^6 = \\frac{400}{10^6} \\times 10^6 = 400 ppm \\label{eq6}\\tag{6} \\\\ [O_3] &amp;= \\frac{n_{O_3}}{n_{total}} \\times 10^9 = \\frac{80}{10^9} \\times 10^9 = 80 ppb \\label{eq7}\\tag{7} \\end{align} \\] Aside from percentage, these may be unusual concentration units to you, so why use them? The “parts per” units are relative units that are only related to the relative amount of certain molecules or atoms present, meaning they do not change with changes in density, something that is particularly useful in the atmosphere as the density of gas molecules decreases as you increase in altitude. The concentration of O2 is 21 pph at the ground and 21 pph at the summit of Everest at an altitude of 8.8 km. Concentration units such as molarity (M or mol/L), with which you are likely more familiar, are absolute concentration units that express the amount of a substance within a defined volume. The concentration of O2 in mol/L is not the same at ground-level as it is at the summit of Everest.

In this section we will talk briefly about how to access the Excel and Word, which will be needed for CHM135 lab and university courses more generally. We will also address best practices in file management to ensure you can quickly and easily find the files you have been working on. Finally, we will talk about some of the practicalities of making the CHM135 lab reports, such as uploading images into a word document and creating a PDF. All of these are useful tools you will use throughout your university career and beyond. 2.1 Accessing the Microsoft Office Suite of Software First and foremost, you must have a working copy of both Microsoft Excel and Word. Current U of T students with a UTmail+ account can access this software for free, see the Microsoft 365 ProPlus site for details. On this site you will see several access options, one is the typical desktop version of the software (for Windows or Mac) where it is downloaded and run on your local computer. The software can also be loaded onto an Android or iOS device. The software can also be used in a web browser. The web version of the software can be accessed via your UTmail+ account at https://mail.utoronto.ca, which will send you to the Microsoft Outlook web interface where you can find the available apps on the lefthand menu or by clicking on the app launcher (the 9 dots on the top left). There is no right or wrong way to access Excel and Word. Most likely, you will want to access your work in different ways depending on your situation. For example, you might want to use the desktop software on your personal computer and the web interface when on a shared computer on campus. Accessing your files readily depends a lot on good file management, which is discussed in the next section. 2.2 Managing your Files In addition to the Microsoft Office software suite, current U of T students have access to OneDrive (top right app in the gif above) which is an online file management system. We strongly suggest you use OneDrive to store and organize your files. Instructions on how to access and navigate the online OneDrive interface can be found here. If you have a personal computer or laptop, syncing OneDrive with that computer is a great option as your files are available on your personal computer for offline work and also backed up and available online. Instructions on how to sync OneDrive with a personal computer can be found here. When saving your work, organization is important so you can easily find files you have been working on. Here is an example for CHM135 where a folder for CHM135 has been created on OneDrive (and synced with a Mac laptop in this case). To further organize the content, subfolders have been created for the class, tutorial, and lab components of the class, and subfolders within the lab for each of the five experiments. Folders can be created in any operating system (Mac or Windows) by right clicking on a blank space in the location where you would like the folder to be placed (FILE EXPLORER for Windows or FINDER for Mac) and selecting NEW FOLDER (Mac) or NEW then FOLDER (Windows). Folder names can be edited by left clicking on the folder to select it and then left clicking again (not a quick double click) to indicate you want to edit the name and then hitting ENTER once you are done editing. The folders in the gif above were created in a directory that is linked between a Mac laptop and the OneDrive App and so there are a few special options available. What do these options do? Always Keep on This Device: This relates to your ability to work on this content offline. If you click on this option the folder or file will be downloaded onto your computer and available offline. Free Up Space: Basically the opposite of Always Keep on This Device, it indicates to OneDrive that this folder or file is not needed for offline work and can be stored online only. This option is useful for shared computers as well as laptops with limited storage. However, it is important to understand that internet access is required to access these files. Share: This will produce a link that can be shared with others to work on a file or folder together. You will need to specify who can view the content, addition details on file sharing through OneDrive can be found here. Version History: This is only available for files, not folders, and relates to the auto-save function in all Microsoft software. If something goes seriously wrong with a file you could look at the version history and revert to a version before the issue arose. View Online: This will open the folder or file on the online OneDrive interface in a web browser. These same options are available on a Windows computer, details on how to access them are outlined on this OneDrive for Windows 10 Microsoft Support page. In addition to choosing whether to download each folder or file individually, OneDrive can be configured with either the Always Keep on This Device or Free Up Space as the default setting. Details on how to configure this on a Windows computer are included on the same OneDrive for Windows 10 Microsoft Support page linked above and for Macs on the OneDrive for Mac Microsoft Support page. 2.3 Creating Professional Documents Using Microsoft Word to produce professional documents with images, and then creating a PDF output is a valuable skill for university courses and future careers. Often graphs or other data visualizations from Excel, are added to Word documents, so let’s start there. 2.3.1 Adding an Excel Graph to a Word Document Excel graphs can be added to Word documents using the copy and paste function. This is as simple as copying the Excel graph using the COPY function from the dropdown menu that appears when you right click on the plot or using the keyboard shortcut (CONTROL+C for Windows and COMMAND+C for Mac). The graph can be added to the Word document using the PASTE function from the right-click dropdown menu or the keyboard shortcut (CONTROL+V for Windows and COMMAND+V for Mac). If this series of steps are carried out in the web interface (as shown in the gif above) the Excel graph will be added as an image. However, if the desktop versions of the software are used the Excel graph will retain the ability to the manipulated and edited using the CHART DESIGN tab that will appear in the Word ribbon if you click on the plot. Double clicking on the parts of the graph will also bring up relevant formatting windows. This pasted graph is still connected to the original Excel file, something that is apparent if you click the EDIT DATA IN EXCEL function in the CHART DESIGN ribbon. Changes made to the plot in Excel will be updated in the word document. However, if the original Excel file is deleted, moved, or its name is changed, this connection is lost and an error will appear if the EDIT DATA IN EXCEL function is selected. In the gif above, when the Excel graph is copied, the cursor hovers briefly over the SAVE AS PICTURE option in the dropdown menu before moving to COPY. If SAVE AS PICTURE is selected the graph can be saved in a variety of common image file types (e.g PNG or JPEG). This can be useful if adding the graph to non-Microsoft software or if you would like to preserve its formatting. 2.3.2 Adding Images to a Word Document There are many reasons you might want to add saved images to a Word document. For the CHM135 lab reports there are questions that ask you to upload plots saved from the CHM135: Exploring Air Quality Data App and, on some reports, opportunities to show your work by taking a picture of your worked solution. In all cases, you should begin by saving the image file in a typical format (e.g. PNG or JPEG) in a known location on your computer or OneDrive. The image can be added by selecting the PICTURES option on the INSERT ribbon, then PICTURE FROM FILE, and the relevant image file located. On the web interface the PICTURE option will prompt you to add the image from THIS DEVICE (your current computer) or OneDrive. If the files on your computer are synced with OneDrive both options will allow you to access the saved image file. Once an image has been added to a word document you can alter its size and alignment. You can also change how the text interacts, or wraps around, the image. Right clicking on the image and selecting WRAP TEXT will show the available options. 2.3.3 Creating a PDF from a Word Document Once you are done creating your word document the best way to disseminate it is to transform it into a PDF so the formatting or other aspects of the document remain intact. On the desktop version of Word you can create a PDF using SAVE AS or SAVE A COPY in the FILE menu then select PDF from the FILE FORMAT dropdown menu. To create a PDF from the online version of Word choose FILE then SAVE AS then DOWNLOAD AS PDF. "],["data-wrangling.html", "Section 3 Data Wrangling 3.1 Opening a CSV file 3.2 Data Discovery and Cell Formatting 3.3 Data Cleaning", " Section 3 Data Wrangling This guide is written for the first-year chemistry courses at the University of Toronto but we hope you will find it useful for a variety of courses and even applications outside of academia. Performing experiments in the lab often involves the production and collection of data. You might feel that any changes, or manipulations, to the data would be dishonest. However, the truth is most data requires some manipulation as part of its analysis. In this section we will discuss how to import your data into Excel (if it’s not already in Excel), how to format it and how to make educated decisions about how to structure and clean your data before you begin your analysis. This section uses the air quality datasets from the NAPS network as an example. If you received a dataset through your CHM135 lab section feel free to use it to follow along. If not, you can visit the Introduction page to download the example dataset used throughout this resource (note that you cannot use the example dataset for your analysis in CHM135). 3.1 Opening a CSV file Many datasets (particularly larger ones) are stored with the “.csv” file extension. The CSV file extension stands for comma-separate values, a popular file format for storing data that you are bound to encounter again in your academic career. As the name implies, CSV files contain data separated by commas. If you’re interested, feel free to open your file in Notepad, TextEdit or Microsoft Word to see this organization. Excel can open CSV files and will typically automatically assign the comma-separated values into different columns. Once you open your CSV file using Excel, save it as an .xlsx file so that you can use all of Excel’s features. It is also best practice to keep a copy of the CSV file saved to your computer separate from the .xlsx file you will use for your analysis just in case something goes wrong and you need to start from scratch with a clean dataset. When you open the NAPS data (or any file) in Excel notice how the values are arrayed in a table of cells, each containing a single value. These cells are arranged in columns labelled by a letter (A, B, C, etc.) and rows labelled using a number (1, 2, 3, etc.). A single cell can be referenced using this system (i.e. in the gif above the cell “B3” contains the value “-20.6”). 3.2 Data Discovery and Cell Formatting Whenever you create a new spreadsheet and start interacting with numbers it is important to understand the meaning of the numbers on the page, including details such as relevant units. The data from the NAPS network is organized into four columns with the following headers that communicate what the numbers in each column represent. Here are some additional details: Date: Indicates the day and time the air quality data was measured. temperature: The ambient air temperature in degrees Celsius. NO2: The concentration of NO2 in the air in ppb. O3: The concentration of O3 in the air in ppb. When collecting data in the lab (light absorbance, pH, temperature…) the values you collect are typically snapshots of the system you’re studying at that moment. The NAPS data is slightly different. The reported values (temperature and concentration) are hour-ending averages, meaning that when you see temperature or concentration for 1 AM, it is the average of the measured values between 12 AM and 1 AM that day. Each cell in an Excel spreadsheet is assigned a formatting type that is displayed in the dialog box on the HOME ribbon. The default setting in Excel is typically GENERAL which means that Excel will use the contents of the cell to judge whether it contains text, or a number, or a equation (more details on that in the [Math, Stats and Programming] section), or a date (more on that below), etc. Although all the cells in the example here are formatted using the GENERAL label you might notice that the text in the column headers are all left justified and the numbers are right justified. This is the default formatting in Excel for these data types and it is done purposefully so you can quickly evaluate whether Excel has properly assessed the contents of the cell. There is no need to change the cell formatting for the Temperature or NO2 and O3 concentration data (although feel free to play around), but it is likely that the data in the Date column is not formatted properly and is instead written as a series of numbers. This issue arises because the date and time of the measurement is communicated to Excel as the number of days since 1900-Jan-0, with a decimal value corresponding to the time of day. Some formatting options in Excel for dates and times are provided in the table below. In the example in this table, 44005 days have passed since 1900-Jan-0, and Excel interprets this as midnight on July 23, 2020. For the NAPS dataset, Excel often misinterprets what is meant to be displayed as a date and time as a number, but this misunderstanding can also go the other way and a numerical value can be incorrectly interpreted as a date. Just remember that the formatting only affects how the numbers are displayed, not the numbers themselves, so the numbers in the Date column are correct you just need to change the formatting so that they are displayed in a way that is meaningful to us as the consumer of this data. Category Description Example General Has no specific format and so for numbers returns the full numerical value 44005 Number General display of numbers, can adjust the number of decimal places 44005.00 Scientific Displays numbers using scientific notations, can adjust the number of decimal places 4.40E+04 Date (long) A date format that gives day, month, year in full written notation Tuesday, June 23, 2020 Date (short) A date format that gives day, month, year in condensed notation 2020-06-23 Custom A date format that gives day, month, year as well as time of day that is useful for our needs in Experiment 1. 2020-06-23 0:00 To change the formatting of the Date column first select the entire column by clicking on the column header (“A”), then right click and select FORMAT CELLS from the dropdown menu. If you’re using the online version of Excel you will select NUMBER FORMAT from the dropdown menu and it will open the NUMBER FORMAT dialog box that includes the relevant formatting options. You can also go to the FORMAT menu and select CELLS or select MORE NUMBER FORMATS from the dropdown menu on the HOME ribbon (so many choices!). In the FORMAT CELLS (or NUMBER FORMAT) dialog box there are many formatting options, some of which are described in the table above. There is no right or wrong way to format the date and time values, but given the NAPS dataset includes both date and time a useful formatting option is the yyyy-mm-dd h:mm option, which displays both date and time in the same cell. This option is not (for some strange reason) available in the DATE category of the FORMAT CELLS dialog box, but instead in the CUSTOM category as shown in the gif below. 3.3 Data Cleaning Cleaning data refers to the process of creating useful and meaningful datasets from which useful and meaningful information can be obtained. In the first-year chemistry lab the process of data cleaning typically involves removing data points that are not useful to the analysis or are below a defined detection limit for the instrumentation in question. At first glance the idea of removing data points might seem suspect and make you worried about academic honest. The key to addressing this concern is that any changes to the data need to be transparent and reproducible, meaning the workflow (e.g. the steps you followed) used to clean the data should be included with the data itself when reporting the results of the analysis and the steps in the workflow should be reproducible such that someone else could adjust their data in the same way. To explore exactly what this means, let’s take a look at the NAPS dataset. Simply looking at the first few rows of the example NAPS data, something pops right out away: the -999 concentration values for both NO2 and O3 at 3 AM on January 7, 2018 in cells C5 and D5. What happened there? If a timeseries is created by plotting the concentration of NO2 and O3 versus time from this data (note that plotting your data here isn’t necessary, but if you would like to, detailed instructions are provided in the Data Visualization section) you would notice there are actually three timepoints that include data with a concentration around -1000 ppb. These concentration values are obviously physically impossible What is happening? These -999 concentration values are present in the dataset because they are reported by the NAPS system whenever there is any doubt in relation to a measurement taken by one of the instruments. A value of -999 was used purposefully in this role as it is immediately noticeable in the dataset and therefore easy to remove. In addition, unlike reporting a missing value, -999 cannot be misinterpreted as zero. Here is our first foray into data cleaning. How do we remove -999 values? Do we need to go through all 168 concentration values for each pollutant to find these outliers? Of course not! This is where we start to explore the functions and operations built into the spreadsheet software to do this work for us! The FIND function in Excel is a great way to look for these -999 values. This function can be found by selecting EDIT then FIND and FIND in the top pulldown menu, or the FIND AND SELECT magnifying glass followed by FIND in the EDITING menu on the HOME ribbon. On the desktop version of Excel you can also use the search bar at the top right of your Excel window (magnifying glass on a Mac and black box on Windows). No matter how you access the FIND function, type -999, hit ENTER, and see what happens. If you find any -999 values you will need to delete the entire row within your dataset If you simply delete the -999 value in the cell, Excel to treat it as a zero for any subsequent mathematical manipulations. Given the concentration was not measured at this time, inadvertently changing the concentration to a value of zero would unintentionally alter the dataset. To delete a row, select it by clicking on the row number on the left then right click and select DELETE from the dropdown menu that appears. Note that simply hitting DELETE on your keyboard will delete the values in the row but not the row itself. A couple of practical notes about using the FIND function. It is important that no cells within the sheet are selected, if cells are selected Excel will only search the selected cells. As the rows are deleted the graph updates automatically. This is useful when formatting the axes of your graph as the format of these values will follow the format in the selected cells (more details on this in the Data Visualization chapter). This the extent of data cleaning required for the NAPS dataset. Now that you have completed your first data cleaning workflow, reflect on how this process could be communicated in a way that is both transparent and reproducible. How would you explain it? Data cleaning workflows will be incorporated into the first year chemistry labs whenever appropriate. Something to note before we leave this topic is the utility of visualizing your data when thinking about how to approach an analysis. The timeseries graph shown in the figure above is not pretty, the axes aren’t yet labelled, it doesn’t have an appropriate title, but it was useful as a first step in this analysis as it quickly and easily allowed us a snapshot of what was happening. "],["math-stats-and-programming.html", "Section 4 Math, Stats, and Programming 4.1 Mathematical Operations 4.2 Cell Referencing 4.3 Spreadsheet Organization 4.4 Simple Statistical Functions 4.5 If Statements 4.6 SUM and COUNT Functions 4.7 SLOPE, INTERCEPT and R2 Functions", " Section 4 Math, Stats, and Programming Physical chemistry is a quantitative science, meaning we use mathematical operations to explain and explore chemical phenomena. This math can be done by hand, but once you have more than one or two data points this gets very tiring and a spreadsheet can be a lifesaver! In this section we will talk about how to program mathematical equations into Excel, how to use common mathematical and statistical functions, and how to reference other values within the spreadsheet. We will also dip our toes into some simple computer programming that can be very useful. The first two subsection Mathematical Operations and Cell Referencing use the air quality datasets from the NAPS network as examples. If you received a dataset through your CHM135 lab section feel free to use it to follow along. If not, you can visit the Introduction page to download the example dataset used throughout this resource (note that you cannot use the example dataset for your analysis in CHM135). 4.1 Mathematical Operations As described in the Introduction, atmospheric chemists have defined the term “odd oxygen” or OX as the sum of the concentrations of NO2 and O3. To add OX to your analysis you will need to calculate the concentration OX at each timepoint. To do this, simply add the cells containing O3 and NO2 for the first timepoint (both concentrations are in ppb so they can be added directly) then copy this formula down the column. When you add a formula into Excel remember to start with an equals sign (“=”), this will let Excel know you are writing a formula. If you are referencing a cell you can either write it in (e.g. “C2”) or you can click on the cell. Once your formula is complete, hit ENTER and Excel will perform the calculation. Excel can perform many mathematical operations and the table below provides a list of some of the most common with their corresponding formula. Input Operator Example… … solves to = Equal sign indicates a mathematical operation + Addition =2+2 4 - Subtraction =3–2 1 * Multiplication =3*2 6 / Division =4/2 2 ^ Exponent =4^2 16 ( ) Brackets to indicate order of operations =(4+2)*2 12 LOG(number,base) Logarithm (10 is the default if no base is indicated) =LOG(100,10) 2 LN(number) Natural Logarithm =LN(2) 0.693… To copy the formula from one cell down the list of data points, you can use the copy and paste function in the edit menu or the keyboard shortcuts CONTROL+C to copy and CONTROL+V to paste in Windows or COMMAND+C and COMMAND+V on a Mac. You can also use a shortcut specific to Excel. Click on the cell with your formula and notice the little square in the lower righthand corner. Click on this square and drag the formula down the column, or, even better, double click on the square and Excel will automatically paste the formula down the column until the end of the series (note that it will stop at the first blank cell so if you are missing values you may need to copy and paste the formula the rest of the way). When you add a new value, make sure you remember to label your column. If you are learning about mathematical operations in Excel for the first time we strongly suggest reading the next section on cell referencing. 4.2 Cell Referencing One of Excel’s strengths is its ability to easily perform mathematical operations in larger datasets. To take advantage of this feature it is important to appreciate how Excel references values in the spreadsheet. Simply referencing a cell in Excel will add a relative reference, which means that the reference will move as the equation is copied and pasted to other cells. This is the type of reference created in the OX calculation in the section above. If you are unsure of the cells being referenced in an equation Excel will visualize the reference when you click on the cell. To exit the function hit escape (ESC) on your keyboard. A relative reference is very useful when calculating a series of numbers, however there are times when you might wish to make an absolute reference, such that it does not move as it is copied and pasted. To do this you add a $ in front of the letter and/or the number in the cell reference. It is possible to add a $ to only the letter (column reference) or the number (row reference) and only lock one aspect of the referencing or to lock both. The gif below, which is a spreadsheet setup to calculate the energy of a photon in J/molecule from its wavelength in nm (if interested, download the example dataset here), is an example that includes both absolute and relative references. The equation to calculate energy includes absolute references to the relevant constants and a relative reference to the wavelength of the photon such that it moves as the equation is copied down the column. As shown in the gif, if the absolute reference is not properly applied the calculated values don’t make any sense. A more complicated example of cell referencing is discussed in the If Statements section below. 4.3 Spreadsheet Organization Before moving on to more complicated functions in Excel it is useful to discuss ways of organizing a spreadsheet, particularly when planning to use cell references. In the example above, the constants were added to the top of the sheet so they could be easily incorporated into the calculation. A limitation of this organization is that it’s not possible to select entire columns using the letter column headers. If you decide to move your constants around, using the CUT and PASTE functions will preserve the cell reference. Cells can be CUT in Excel by selecting CUT from the dropdown menu that appears when you right click or using the keyboard shortcuts, CONTROL+X in Windows and COMMAND+X on a Mac. You can also add rows or columns to your sheet by selecting INSERT from the dropdown menu when you right click. The number of rows or columns added correspond to the number highlighted and the rows will be added above your selection and the columns to the left of your selection. There is no one right way to organize a spreadsheet, but when using values that need to be referenced or values that are calculated it is useful to plan their position in the sheet and to be able to move them if your original position isn’t optimal. 4.4 Simple Statistical Functions When we have several measurements it is often useful to know how they compare to one another. To get a sense of that we can employ some simple statistical functions. One such function is a mean or average value, given the symbol \\(\\overline{x}\\). Another typical function is a standard deviation, given the symbol \\(\\sigma\\). We typically understand what a mean value represents, but what is a standard deviation? The mathematical formula for the standard deviation of a set of values is shown in equation (\\(\\ref{eq8}\\)): \\[ \\begin{align} \\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\overline{x})^{2}}{N-1}} \\label{eq8}\\tag{8} \\end{align} \\] where \\(x_i\\) is the individual data points within the dataset; \\(\\overline{x}\\) is the mean value of the dataset; and N is the number of values in the dataset. Looking at this formula it is clear that standard deviation is related to the difference between the individual values in the dataset and the mean value of the dataset. Standard deviation is a useful metric for appreciating the spread in the data. The greater the spread, the greater the standard deviation. More specifically, as shown in the figure below, one standard deviation away from the mean on either side will include 68% of the data points and two standard deviations will include 95% of the data. Standard deviation is a useful metric. The magnitude of the spread in the data is often related to the overall magnitude of the values. For example, the standard deviation of 0.5 is large for a dataset with a mean value of 1, but small for a dataset with a mean value of 50. To provide this context the relative standard deviation (RSD) can be calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean value and then multiplying this ratio by 100 (equation (\\(\\ref{eq9}\\)). \\[ \\begin{align} RSD = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\overline{x}} \\times 100 \\label{eq9}\\tag{9} \\end{align} \\] The RSD of a dataset expresses the magnitude of the spread in the data using a percentage to normalize for differences in magnitude (e.g. a dataset with a mean value of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.5 has an RSD of 50%, and that with a mean value of 50 and a standard deviation of 0.5 has an RSD of 1%). The table below presents formula and descriptions to calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, as well as the minimum and maximum values for a set of numbers. Calculation Formula Description Mean =AVERAGE(number1, [number2], …) Returns the arithmetic mean of the inputs. Median =MEDIAN(number1, [number2], …) Returns the middle number in a group of supplied number. Standard Deviation =STDEV(number1, [number2], …) Returns the standard deviation of the samples provided. Minimum =MIN(number1, [number2], …) Returns the minimum value in a set of numbers. Maximum =MAX(number1, [number2], …) Returns the maximum value in a set of numbers. The figure below provides some context on how to use these formulas with an example calculating the mean, median, standard deviation, relative standard deviation, minimum and maximum values of a list of outdoor summer temperatures in Toronto (if interested, download the example dataset here). The formula for each calculation is provided as text next to the value in question (note the quotation marks, which indicate to Excel that the contents of the cell should be treated as text). Keep in mind that Excel will help you with these calculations, once you put an equal sign into the equation bar and start typing it will give you suggestions of possible functions, don’t be afraid to use them. Once you select the function and the brackets are open you can also select one cell, or a series of cells, using the cursor as opposed to writing them in. 4.5 If Statements Now that you have used some simple statistical functions in Excel, let’s explore some other functions and simple computer programming. The first function we will explore is the use of “if” statements. “if” is a conditional statement that signals to Excel that a decision will need to be made. As with the functions described in the Simple Statistical Functions section, once you start the formula by writing “=i” into the formula bar Excel will provide you with many possible functions. Choose “IF”. Once you choose the IF function, Excel will again help you by explaining what the function requires to operate, in this case a logical test and a result for when the test is true and for when it is false. As is typical in more sophisticated Excel programming, each of these requirements is separated by commas. To see how the IF function can be applied, let’s imagine a scenario where a small cafe has four employees and needs to sort out the hours they have worked (if interested, download the example dataset here). In this case the timekeeping software exports a ledger that indicates the employee, day, time, and number of hours they worked. The cafe employer would like to sort this information so that they have a clear picture of the number of hours worked by each employee over the course of the week. To do this they create a column header that includes the employee’s names (Ayaan, Charlotte, Melena and Zambala) and then write IF statements for each that only add the number of hours into the column if the employee’s name is found in that row. As described above the IF always includes: Logical Test: in this case, the logical test is asking whether the name in a given row matches the name at the top of the column (note the use of a relative reference for the name in the row and an absolute reference for the column header, details on referencing can be found in the Cell Referencing section). Value If True: here the formula selects the number of hours for the row being investigated as this is what we would like to display if that employee was the one to work these hours. Value If False: here the formula indicates the conditional statement should report a empty cell (indicated by the empty brackets ““) if the employee mentioned in this row does not match the name at the top of the column. To copy this first IF statement to the remaining employees we could try to simply copy and paste the cell itself to the next column, but (as shown in the gif below, or if you try it yourself) this would move all the relative references and cause a mess. To address this we need to rethink the relative and absolute references used in the gif above. Before you go through the changes made below, challenge yourself to write out the changes you think would work by hand or work through it using the dataset provided. Here are the changes that need to be implemented so that the function can be copied across both columns and rows: Logical Test: The reference to the employee name in column A needs an absolute reference on the column, so it doesn’t more as you copy the formula to the other columns, but a relative reference to the row so it moves as the formula is copy down the rows. Conversely the reference to the names in the column headers needs a relative reference on the column but an absolute reference on the row. Value If True: Similar to employee name in column A, hours worked in column E need an absolute reference on the column but a relative reference on the row. Value If False: No cell references here. 4.6 SUM and COUNT Functions Excel includes many useful functions, far too many to outline here. A couple of very useful functions are the the SUM and COUNT functions. As the name suggests, the SUM function returns the sum of a range of numbers. The COUNT function returns the number of values in the outlined range. Both of these functions can be combined with the IF function using the SUMIF and COUNTIF functions where values are summed or counted only if certain criteria are met. The AVERAGE function introduced in the Simple Statistical Functions section can also be included with an IF statement using the AVERAGEIF function. Calculation Formula Description Sum =SUM(number1, [number2], …) Returns the sum of the inputs Sum If =SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range]) Returns the sum of the inputs based on the outlined criteria Count =COUNT(value1, [value2], …) Returns the number of values in the given range Count If =COUNTIF(range, criteria) Returns the number of values in the given range based on the outlined criteria Mean If =AVERAGEIF(range, criteria, [average_range]) Returns the arithmetic mean of the inputs based on the outlined criteria To explore these functions let’s take another look at the book-keeping exercise from the If Statements section. Imagine the hours for each employee need to be summed over the week. This can be accomplished using the SUM function. The number of shifts worked can also be determined using the COUNT function, and the average length of the shifts using the AVERAGE function. The work flow outlined above is a two-step process that first uses an IF statement and then the SUM, COUNT and AVERAGE functions. This works perfectly well. The two functions can also be combined using the SUMIF, COUNTIF and AVERAGEIF functions. To accomplish this, select the range of values that will be used to judge the criteria, the criteria itself, and then the range to be summed, counted or averaged. 4.7 SLOPE, INTERCEPT and R2 Functions The relationship between many variables in chemistry can be explained using a linear regression line with equation y = mx + b. Excel can add linear trendlines with equations and R2 values to scatterplots. Details on how to do, as well as a discussion of what a linear regression entails, are provided in the Adding a Linear Regression Line subsection of the Data visualization section of this resource. If the equation of the linear trendline is required for subsequent calculations it is useful to calculate the slope (m) and intercept (b) in the body of the spreadsheet as opposed to simply reading them off of the graph. The functions used to do perform these calculations are provided in the table below. Calculation Formula Description Slope =SLOPE(known_ys, known_xs) Returns the slope of the linear trendline Intercept =INTERCEPT(known_ys, known_xs) Returns the intercept of the linear trendline R2 =RSQ(known_ys, known_xs) Returns the R2 of the linear regression, which is a measure of how well the line predicts the variation observed in the data The GIF below provides an example executing these functions using the dataset introduced in the Adding a Linear Regression Line subsection that compares the number of computer science PhDs graduating in the US with US arcade revenues each year. If we assume the number of US computer science PhDs graduating in a given year is a good predictor of US arcade revenues (which we certainly do not know to be the case, but just humor me) then we could use the equation of the trendline to predict US arcade revenues in a year when the US graduated 1300 computer science PhDs. Although there is no clear utility to the data used in this example, it is clear that having the slope and intercept of a linear equation available in the body of the Excel sheet can facilitate subsequent calculations.

Visualizations are also a powerful way to communicate these relationships. In this section we will discuss the creation of the most common type of plot in chemistry: the scatterplot. How to make changes to a plot, how to add and format axes labels and how to add trendlines. The majority of this section uses the air quality datasets from the NAPS network as an example. If you received a dataset through your CHM135 lab section feel free to use it to follow along. If not, you can visit the Introduction page to download the example dataset used throughout this resource (note that you cannot use the example dataset for your analysis in CHM135). 5.1 Creating a Scatterplot Many physical chemistry labs result in the collection of a series of data with an independent (time, volume…) and a dependent (absorption, pH, temperature…) variable. Comparing these variables often involves plotting the independent variable on the x-axis and the dependent variable on the y-axis as a scatterplot, which plots each data point independently on the grid space of the graph. This model of data analysis is where we will begin our analysis of the relationship between NO2, O3 and OX in the NAPS dataset by creating a timeseries where the concentrations of the chemicals (dependent variable) are plotted over time (independent variable). To create a scatterplot, select the columns of data you want to visualize and then go to the INSERT ribbon and select CHARTS, then SCATTER, then SCATTER again (this selection may look like a button with a picture of a little scatterplot). Alternatively, you can select the INSERT tab, then CHARTS, then X Y (Scatter). If you would like to make a plot with more than 1 dataset included, as in the GIF below, then you can select all of the columns in question and create the scatterplot as described. You can select an entire column by clicking on the column heading, and if you need to select columns that are not directly adjacent to one another hold the CTRL button in Windows or COMMAND on a Mac and click on the column headings you wish to select. The first thing to do once you make a plot is to simply look at it. Are the correct values plotted on the correct axes? Are the values properly formatted? Here is the plot that resulted from the GIF above. What do you think? Although this figure is a bit difficult to read, from the flow of the points it looks as though the date and time is plotted on the x-axis and concentration on the y-axis. If you haven’t removed all of the -999 values in your dataset you might see some outlier values. If this is the case the Data Cleaning section walks you through how to remove them. 5.2 Changing Chart Type or Design As mentioned above, scatterplots are the most common type of plot in the chemistry lab as the data collected is discrete. However, as is often the case, rules were meant to be broken. Adding a continuous smooth line will make relationships between the variables much easier to visualize, and will also allow us to practice changing a chart type after a plot has been generated. To do this click on the plot, then select the CHART DESIGN ribbon, then CHANGE CHART TYPE, then X Y (Scatter), then SCATTER WITH SMOOTH LINES (note that the last menu often appears as pictures of plots and so choose the one with a smooth line). This is also the menu you would choose if you wanted to change the chart type to visualize your data in another way (e.g. bar chart). 5.3 Adding Axis Labels and a Chart Title Once you have confirmed your graph is appropriate you will need to add axes titles. To do this, click on the plot, then click on the CHART DESIGN ribbon, then ADD CHART ELEMENT, then AXIS TITLES and add titles to both the x-axis (PRIMARY HORIZONTAL) and y-axis (PRIMARY VERTICAL). Once the axes titles are present, you can edit them to an appropriate label and remember to include units if relevant. A chart title is typically added automatically, but if not, the ADD CHART ELEMENT menu is also where you can find the CHART TITLE menu. Once the title is present you can edit it. Note that the addition of subscript or superscript text to an Excel chart title or axis label will require that you select the text in question, right click on it, select FONT, and then select the change you want. 5.4 Formatting Axis Labels Looking at the graph it is obvious that the x-axis is not properly formatted. To format an axis, double click the axis values to reveal the FORMAT AXIS option panel that includes two tabs AXIS OPTIONS and TEXT OPTIONS. Here you have many options to explore. The timeseries dates are complicated as a simple adjustment of font size is not enough to make it easy to read. There are two ways to approach adjusting the date and time displayed on the x-axis: Adjust the spacing of the major and minor units in the AXIS OPTIONS tab Adjust how the text is displayed in the TEXT OPTIONS tab The major and minor units of the x-axis can be adjusted in the AXIS OPTIONS tab of the FORMAT AXIS panel. In the plot we are working on, the major unit was set to 1 (meaning every day is displayed) and the minor unit to 0.2. In this case the major unit corresponds to a gridline and a value displayed on the x-axis, while the minor unit is not displayed. Try changing these to something larger so that the date values are more spaced out. In the GIF below the major unit was changed to 2 and then to 3 and the minor unit to 1. One of the consequences of changing the major and minor units of the x-axis is that it may change the bounds of the plot. To adjust this, the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM values of the axis can be adjusted in the BOUNDS menu of the AXIS OPTIONS tab to reflect the 7 days in your dataset. Remember that Excel stores date and time values using numerical values (see the Data Wrangling section for more details). To adjust the bounds, add or subtract integer values (i.e. 1, 2, 3) to the minimum and maximum until your data is properly framed. Notice how changes made in the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM values of the axis update as soon as you click elsewhere, this is useful when playing around to find the proper framing for the data. To adjust the x-axis by changing the direction of the text, select the TEXT OPTIONS tab of the FORMAT AXIS panel, find the TEXT BOX options box and change the angle of the text either by selecting an option such as ROTATED 90o from the TEXT DIRECTION menu or changing the value in the CUSTOM ANGLE box. One final note about axis formatting is that you may want to change how the values themselves are formatted (for example you may only want to see the date values and not the time in your timeseries). Remember that the values displayed in the graph are tied to specific values in your Excel sheet, and so any adjustments made to the values in the sheet will be reflected in the graph. 5.5 Adding a Linear Regression Line One way to explore the relationship between O3 and NO2 is to create a correlation plot, which is essentially a plot of two variables against one another to visualize how they relate to one another. To accomplish this, first create a scatterplot as described above, but this time the x-axis will correspond to the concentration of NO2 and the y-axis to the concentration O3. Then to assess if there is any correlation between the two pollutants, we’ll perform a linear least squares regression analysis. Linear refers to the fact that the relationship can be expressed as a straight line defined by the equation y = mx + b. Least squares means that the trendline is the best approximation of the given dataset, while still being a straight line. Lastly, the term regression means we’re going to estimate the relationship between two variables. Excel calculates the linear least squares regression trendline by minimizing the vertical distance (squares) between every actual value and its predicted value on the trendline. For example, in the figure below, the two lines (black and green) are both linear, but the black line is a better trendline as the sum of the squared distances between the points (the length of the arrows) is less than the green line. It’s important to remember that the ideal trendline may be farther from individual points than others (it might not touch any points at all), but the summed distance is the shortest. The first step to performing a linear regression in Excel is to add a linear trendline to your scatterplot. To do this right click on any of the data points in your plot and select ADD TRENDLINE from the dropdown menu. In the FORMAT TRENDLINE panel select LINEAR trendline, and then select DISPLAY EQUATION ON CHART and DISPLAY R-SQUARED VALUE ON CHART. Your plot should now resemble the plot in the GIF below (if interested, download the example dataset here, which was taken from Tyler Vigen’s collection of spurious Correlations). You are likely very familiar with format of an equation for a linear line, but may be less familiar with interpreting an R2 value. The R2 value of a linear regression is a measure of how well the line predicts the variation observed in the data. It can be summarized by this very general relationship: \\[ \\begin{align} R^2 = \\frac{\\text{variance explained by the model}}{\\text{total variance}} \\label{eq10}\\tag{10} \\end{align} \\] The takehome message of this equation is that the closer R2 is to 1, the better the regression line describes the relationship between the two variables (aka the closer the line is to every plotted point). The R2 of a trendline is a useful value, but it is only describing the variance in the data, and so a higher R2 does not prove the correlation between two variables just as a low R2 does not disprove it. The data shown in the GIF above has a positive relationship. Between the years 2000 and 2009, the number of computer science PhDs graduating in the United States increased and so did the revenues from arcades. This is a positive correlation as the two variables increase or decrease together. This is evident visually and in the positive value of the slope of the trendline. Variables are negatively correlated when one increases the other decreases, in which case the slope of the trendline would be negative. Does the observed correlation between arcade revenues and computer sciences PhDs mean one variable caused the other (causation)? Maybe, maybe not. It’s not possible to answer this question using this plot and the R2 value alone, but the correlation observed between the two variables suggests the relationship may warrant further investigation. 5.6 Adding a Dataseries to an Existing Plot The timeseries generated in the Creating a Scatterplot subsection above had all of the data ready to plot, but that’s not always the case. If we pretend the timeseries was made before the OX values were calculated, we can then add the OX dataseries to the plot to demonstrate this workflow. In the GIF below the OX data series is deleted and then re-added. To add a new dataseries to a plot right click on the plot and click SELECT DATA from the dropdown menu (or go to the CHART DESIGN ribbon and click SELECT DATA). In the SELECT DATA SOURCE dialog box you should see the two data series already on your plot for NO2 and O3. Directly above this list, click ADD in Windows or “+” directly below the list on a Mac and the EDIT SERIES dialog box will open. This dialog box includes three boxes entitled SERIES NAME:, SERIES X VALUES: and SERIES Y VALUES: (on Mac no new dialog box will open, but a data series will be added to the list and the boxes NAME:, X VALUES: and Y VALUES: will become available). To input information into these three boxes you can type directly into the box or click the arrow (on Mac this looks more like a little Excel sheet) to select data from your Excel sheet. The SERIES NAME: box is what your dataset will be referred to in the chart legend. You can type “Ox” directly in the box, or you can select the column header. For the SERIES X VALUES: and SERIES Y VALUES: select the relevant data in your sheet without including the column headers. When you have multiple dataseries on the same plot you can format or add trendlines to each of these plots in the same way you would on a simpler plot with only one dataseries. For formatting options simply double click on the dataseries in question to open the FORMAT DATA SERIES dialog box. To add a trendline select the relevant dataseries right click and select ADD TRENDLINE from the dropdown menu. All of the options from the [Adding a Trendline] section will be available and apply only to the selected dataseries. As an example a trendline is added to the OX dataseries in the GIF below, this trendline is simply to demonstrate how to do it and is not a useful addition to this analysis. 5.7 Annotating a Plot One final aspect of plotting in Excel that will be useful in the first year chemistry labs is the ability to annotate a graph. These annotations can be used to indicate interesting aspects of a plot and as a tool for data analysis. To annotate a plot on the desktop version of Excel, select the plot followed by the FORMAT ribbon that appears and then the INSERT SHAPE function and the shape of interest from the dropdown menu. The annotation tool is not available on the online version of Excel and so in this case the plot should be copied into PowerPoint and annotated there.
