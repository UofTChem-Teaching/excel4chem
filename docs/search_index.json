We will also address best practices in file management so you can work efficiently and be sure you can quickly and easily find the files you have been working on. 2.1 Software Requirements First and foremost, you must have a working copy of Microsoft Excel. The demonstrations and instructions will be based on Microsoft Excel for Microsoft 365. Current U of T students with a UTmail+ account can access the full desktop and mobile versions. For assistance downloading the software, consult the U of T libraries website (https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/ic-faq-categories/office-365-proplus). On this site you will see two options for access the Microsoft Office software, one is the typical desktop version where the software is downloaded and run on your local computer. This is the typical way to run this software and until recently was the only way. The second way to access this software is via the web interface where the software runs in a web browser. The web version of the software can be accessed via your UTmail+ account at mail.utoronto.ca, which will send you to the Microsoft Outlook web interface where you can find all the available apps by clicking on the app launcher (the 9 dots on the top left). Figure 1. App launcher that can be accessed via your UTmail+ account at mail.utoronto.ca. There is no right or wrong way to access Microsoft Excel in this experiment, in fact it may make sense to access your work in different ways depending on your situation. Maybe you use the desktop software on your personal computer and the web interface when on a shared computer on campus. How you access your files depends a lot on where they are saved, something that will be discussed in the next section. 2.2 File Management In addition to the Microsoft Office software suite, current U of T students have access to OneDrive (top right app in Figure 1) which is an online file management system. We strongly suggest you use OneDrive to store and organize your files. Details on how to access OneDrive using the web interface, as well as how to sync OneDrive with your personal computer can be found here: https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/ic-faq-categories/onedrive. If you have a personal computer or laptop, syncing OneDrive with that computer is a great option as your files are available on your personal computer for offline work and are also always backed up and available online. Once you decide where you would like to save your work, it is important to organize this space so you can easily find files you have been working on. Here is an example for CHM135 where a folder for CHM135 has been created on OneDrive (and synced with a Mac laptop in this case). To further organize the content subfolders have been created for the class, tutorial, and lab components of the class and subfolders within the lab for each of the five experiments. Figure 2. Example file organization for CHM135. "],["file-upload-and-data-formatting.html", "Section 3 File Upload and Data Formatting 3.1 Opening a CSV File 3.2 Data Organization and Cell Formatting", " Section 3 File Upload and Data Formatting This guide is written for the first-year chemistry courses at the University of Toronto but would be useful for a variety of applications in academia and beyond. 3.1 Opening a CSV File Many datasets (particularly larger ones) are stored as .csv files. The CSV file extension stands for comma-separate values file, a popular file format for storing data that you are bound to encounter again in your academic careers. As the name implies, CSV files contain data separated by commas; go ahead and open your file in Notepad/TextEdit or Microsoft Word if you want to see this. Excel can open CSV files and will often automatically assigned the comma-separated values into different columns. Once you open your .csv file using excel be sure to save it as an .xlsx file so that you can avail yourself of all of Excel’s features. 3.2 Data Organization and Cell Formatting Once you have a dataset open, look at it and notice how the numbers are arrayed in a table of cells, each containing a single value. These cells are arranged in columns with labelled headings (A, B, C, etc.) and rows (1, 2, 3, etc.). A single cell can be referenced using this system (i.e. in the image above the cell “B3” contains the value 19.7). Figure 1. Initial layout of Excel and imported data. Excel displays pound signs (###) if a cell is too narrow to display the value. You can manually adjust the width of columns by dragging the boundary on the right side of the column heading or double clicking the right boundary to automatically adjust it to the width of its contents. Figure 2. Looking at the four windows in the figure from top to bottom: the column is too narrow for data; the data is not displayed as a date; the data is display as date online with time; cells are properly formatted using yyyy—mm-dd hh:mm. Note the double-sided arrow for adjusting column width at the heading boundary in the topmost image. Figure 3. The FORMAL CELLS dialog box. If any of your cells are not properly formatted, right click on them and select FORMAT CELLS… from the dropdown menu (you can also go to the FORMAT menu and select CELLS…). In the FORMAT CELLS dialog box (Figure 3) you can see many formatting options, some of which are described in Table 1. If your dataset includes a date you can format it so that it shows both the date and the time using the CUSTOM category and the yyyy-mm-dd h:mm formatting option as shown in Figure 3. Need to add Table 1 "],["data-wrangling.html", "Section 4 Data Wrangling 4.1 Find and Replace Function", " Section 4 Data Wrangling When we collect data in the lab we often feel that any changes, or manipulations, to the data would be dishonest. However, the truth is that most data requires some manipulation as part of its analysis. 4.1 Find and Replace Function The find and replace function is useful if you need to find data in your Excel sheet. This is relevant when using the air quality data from the NAPS program as instruments will report a -999 value when data wasn’t collected or there was a quality control issue. If you have -999 values in your dataset you will need to find and remove it before proceeding as it will interfere with your analysis and visualization. To do this you can enter ‘-999’ in the search bar at the top right of the screen and then delete any of these values manually leaving a blank cell behind. Alternatively, if you would like to get Excel to do this work for you, you can select EDIT on the top menu, then select FIND and then REPLACE… In the FIND WHAT: box in the FIND AND REPLACE dialog box input ‘-999’ and leave the REPLACE WITH: box empty. Then click REPLACE ALL and Excel will replace all the ‘-999’ values with blank cells and tell you how many instances the -999 value was replaced. If you have a plot already created from this data it should be updated automatically. Replacing the -999 values with blanks will not work if you need to use those values in a calculation, such as the calculation of Ox. To fix this issue you will need to remove any rows with missing data. To do this, highlight all the columns involved (likely A-E in this example), select the EDIT menu, then FIND, and GO TO. In the GO TO dialog box click on SPECIAL. In the GO TO SPECIAL dialog box select BLANKS, then click OK. This will highlight any cells that are blank in the columns you highlighted. You can remove the rows manually by right clicking on the row number and selecting DELETE from the dropdown menu. Alternatively, with the blank cells highlighted, you can select the HOME ribbon, then click on the arrow next to the DELETE button, then select DELETE SHEET ROWS in the dropdown menu. No matter the approach it is important to delete the entire row, otherwise Excel will move the values up in that column only, which will alter the dataset. Once you remove all the relevant rows scroll to the bottom of your dataset and ensure the columns are of equal length, if not, you may have accidentally deleted a single cell rather than the entire row.

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.

Student’s can just paste into excel and work along with the chapter. 6.2 Animated GIFS We can readily record gifs of our Excel operations, and embedded them directly into the bookdown book. For the example below, I used LICEcap. It’s lightweight, and does exactly what I wanted it to. 6.3 Embedded videos And lastly, we can readily embed videos directly on the webpage. Based on the video below, if CHM135 students could have used their excel skills to close major business dealings in 1992… 6.4 Jessica Test, Woo hoo!
