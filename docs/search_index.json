We’re not trying to be an exhaustive resource for all chemists or courses. Rather, we’re focusing on developing broadly applicable data science course content (tutorials and recipes) based in Microsoft Excel for chemistry courses and research.

This will mimic Lab 1. ## # A tibble: 6 × 4 ## NAPS Time O3 NO2 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 60435 2019-01-01 00:00:00 8 10 ## 2 60435 2019-01-01 01:00:00 5 14 ## 3 60435 2019-01-01 02:00:00 9 8 ## 4 60435 2019-01-01 03:00:00 12 6 ## 5 60435 2019-01-01 04:00:00 13 7 ## 6 60435 2019-01-01 05:00:00 17 5 We can also make it even easier to directly copy the table for smaller example data sets. Student’s can just paste into excel and work along with the chapter. 2.2 Animated GIFS We can readily record gifs of our Excel operations, and embedded them directly into the bookdown book. For the example below, I used LICEcap. It’s lightweight, and does exactly what I wanted it to. 2.3 Embedded videos And lastly, we can readily embed videos directly on the webpage. Based on the video below, if CHM135 students could have used their excel skills to close major business dealings in 1992… 2.4 Jessica Test, Woo hoo! Really looking forward to the textbook coming together! Otter Baby "],["scatterplots.html", "Section 3 Scatterplots 3.1 Including Plots", " Section 3 Scatterplots This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. When you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2.00 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26.00 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36.00 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 42.98 ## 3rd Qu.:19.0 3rd Qu.: 56.00 ## Max. :25.0 Max. :120.00 3.1 Including Plots You can also embed plots, for example: Note that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
