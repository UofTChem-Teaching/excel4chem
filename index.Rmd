# Preface {-}

Hello and Welcome the University of Toronto's **First Year Chemistry Online Excel Resource**!

This online resource was created to help students succeed in first year chemistry and beyond. We hope you find it useful! 

This book will is broken up into five sections: 

**[Introduction]**
Many examples in this resource use air quality data from Environment and Climate Change Canadaâ€™s [National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) program](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-pollution/monitoring-networks-data/national-air-pollution-program.html). This section provides the necessary background information on the chemistry of air quality so that you understand the *why* of many of the Excel manipulations discussed. If you are accessing this resource for a class this introductory material is often provided on Quercus and this section is not relevant.

**[Getting Setup for Success]**
This section takes you through how to access Excel and Word as a U of T student, how to organize and backup your files and how to create professional documents. 

**[Data Wrangling]**
This section takes you through the process of data analysis from opening your file, through properly formatting the cells, to cleaning the data to produce a dataset that is ready for further analysis.

**[Math, Stats, and Programming]**
This section explores how to input mathematical formulas into Excel and many useful functions.

**[Data Visualization ]**
This section explores typical ways of visualizing data in the chemistry lab and how to alter and adjust these plots.
