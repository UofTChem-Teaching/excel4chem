# Getting Setup for Success {#capabilities}

Like many things in life, putting in some organizational work at the start will pay off in increased efficiency later. In this section we will talk briefly about how to access the Excel and Word, which will be needed for CHM135 lab and university courses more generally.  We will also address best practices in file management to ensure you can quickly and easily find the files you have been working on. Finally, we will talk about some of the practicalities of making the CHM135 lab reports, such as uploading images into a word document and creating a PDF. All of these are useful tools you will use throughout your university career and beyond.

## Accessing the Microsoft Office Suite of Software

First and foremost, you must have a working copy of both Microsoft Excel and Word. Current U of T students with a UTmail+ account can access this software for free, see this U of T libraries website for details: https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/ic-faq-categories/office-365-proplus. On this site you will see two access options, one is the typical desktop version where the software is downloaded and run on your local computer.  This is the typical way to run this software and until recently was the only way.  The second way to access this software is via the web interface where the software runs in a web browser. The web version of the software can be accessed via your UTmail+ account at mail.utoronto.ca, which will send you to the Microsoft Outlook web interface where you can find all the available apps by clicking on the app launcher (the 9 dots on the top left).

There is no right or wrong way to access Microsoft Excel and Word. Most likely, you will want to access your work in different ways depending on your situation. For example, you might want to use the desktop software on your personal computer and the web interface when on a shared computer on campus. Accessing your files readily depends a lot on good file management, which is discussed in the next section.

## Managing your Files

In addition to the Microsoft Office software suite, current U of T students have access to OneDrive (top right app in the Figure above) which is an online file management system. We strongly suggest you use OneDrive to store and organize your files. Instructions on how to access and navigate the online OneDrive interface can be found [here](https://uthrprod.service-now.com/infocomm?id=kb_article&sys_id=397eb257dba0d0105030735a8c9619d7).  If you have a personal computer or laptop, syncing OneDrive with that computer is a great option as your files are available on your personal computer for offline work and also backed up and available online. Instructions on how to sync OneDrive with a personal computer can be found [here](https://uthrprod.service-now.com/infocomm?id=kb_article&sys_id=786db1a5db36b05094a03342399619db).

When saving your work, organization is important so you can easily find files you have been working on. Here is an example for CHM135 where a folder for CHM135 has been created on OneDrive (and synced with a Mac laptop in this case). To further organize the content subfolders have been created for the class, tutorial, and lab components of the class and subfolders within the lab for each of the five experiments.

Folders can typically be created in any operating system (mac or windows) by right clicking on a blank space in the location where you would like the folder to be and selecting NEW FOLDER on a Mac or NEW then FOLDER on a Windows computer. Folder names can be edited by left clicking on the folder to select it and then left clicking again (not a quick double click) to indicate you want to edit the name and then hitting ENTER once you are done editing.

```

The folders in the gif above were created in a directory that is linked between a Mac laptop and the OneDrive App and so there are a few special options available:

- **Always Keep on This Device** - This relates to your ability to work on this content offline. If you click on this option the folder or file will be downloaded onto the computer you are working on and stored there so you can access it whether or not you are connected to the internet. When you are connected to the internet OneDrive will still sync this folder and file. 

- **Free Up Space** - This is basically the opposite of *Always Keep on This Device* and tells OneDrive that this folder or file is not needed for offline work and can be stored only on the online OneDrive system. This means when you go to work on this material your computer will need to download it from OneDrive (or access it through the web interface) and so if you are offline it will not be available. This option is useful for shared computers as well as laptops with limited storage.

- **Share** - This will produce a link that can be shared with others to work on a file or folder together. You will need to specify who can view the content, addition details on file sharing through OneDrive can be found [here](https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/ic-faq/37309).

- **Version History** - This is only available for files, not folders, and relates to the auto-save function in all Microsoft software. If something goes seriously wrong with a file you could look at the version history and revert to a version before the issue arose.

- **View Online** - This will open the folder or file on the online OneDrive interface in a web browser. 


## Creating Professional Documents

Using Microsoft Word to produce professional documents with images, and then creating a PDF output is a valuable skill for university courses and future careers.  Often graphs or other data visualization from Excel, are added to Word documents, so letâ€™s start there.

### Adding an Excel Graph into a Word Document

One way to add a graph in Excel to a document in Word is to simply copy and paste it. An interesting aspect of this approach is that the Excel graph is not an image file, but is still connected to the Excel file it came from and can be further manipulated and altered, as shown in the gif below. There is nothing wrong with this and if you have careful file management (meaning the Excel file doesn't get moved or deleted or have its name changed) it works well. However, if you would like the content of the Word document to be independent of the Excel file you can add the graph as an image.

The first step to adding an Excel graph as an image to a Word document is to the save the graph as an image. To do this select the graph with your cursor, right click and select *Save as Image*. Then you can save your graph in an appropriate location with an appropriate title.

Now that you have a created an image of your graph you can add it anywhere you would like in your Word document. Simply place your cursor wherever you would like to add the image in the document and on the *Insert* menu select *Pictures* > *Pictures from File*. Once the image is in your document you can alter its size and alignment. You can also change how the text interacts with the image, meaning is it in line with the text (in line), does the text go around on the side of the image (square), or is the image simply in front or behind the text (in front / behind).

### Creating a PDF from a Word Document

Once you are done creating your word document the best way to disseminate it is to transform it into a PDF so the formatting or other aspects of the document remain intact. On the desktop version of Word you can create a PDF using the *Save a Copy...* function in the *file* menu.

To create a PDF from the mobile version of Word choose *file* then *Save as* then *Download as PDF*.
